# UFO - Universal FlyOut

A World of Warcraft addon.

**_ALPHA_** pre-release and full of bugs.

UFO lets you create custom actionbar flyout menus similar to the ones Blizzard provides for collections of similar spells such as mage portals & teleports, warlock demons, dragonriding abilities, etc.  However, in addition to just spells, UFO also supports:

* Items
* Mounts
* Pets
* Macros
* And yes, Spells

Many thanks to [SÃ©bastien Desvignes](https://github.com/Boboseb) and his addon [FloFlyout](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/floflyout) which was the basis for all my work here.  UFO would not exist without his pre-existing work.
